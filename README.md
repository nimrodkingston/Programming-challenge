# Programming-challenge
This repository contains all of the project work I have used which includes:  

-java source code which is located 
in the file location: programming_challenge\src\main\java\challenge\database\programming_challenge

-html template files for the web application which is 
located in the file location: programming_challenge\src\main\resources\templates

-an application.properties file which is located in
the file location: programming_challenge\src\main\resources\

-an export of the database which I populated with test data which is
located in the top of this repository

-a pom.xml file which contains all of the dependancies I have used for this project

NOTE: The application.properties file currently has hibernate.auto set to none which assumes that a database structure already exists rather than making
a new one.

NOTE: The username and password in application.properties are set to the root and the password that I used for my development however, if you wish to connect to
a different MySQL database, you may need to change the username and password to ones which are relevant to the database you will be using.
